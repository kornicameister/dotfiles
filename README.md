## Most notable

### Awesome upgrade binary

![upgrade_output](.img/upgrade_bin.png)

- upgrades system packages along with clean up
- executes `purge-old-kernels`, what do I need old kernels for?
- upgrades `docker-compose` if there's a never version available
- cleans up docker artifacts, but only those that are old enough
- upgrades `node` and `Python` "system" wide packages
  - actually I do not use native Python and node, there is `nodenv` and `pyenv` magic beneath
- upgrades my `Neovim` plugins, removes old one and install those that were added previously (if needed)
- upgrades `git-extras`
- refreshes all `snap`
- removes thumbnails that I create when I need to find something without shell
- upgrades `ctags` that I built myself for these dotfiles
  - version is kept inside [local git](./gitconfig#L19) configuration (sneaky)

### CI system

My dotfiles are evaluated in the CI system that ensures me that, if needed, I will be able to
deploy them in the fresh system without having too much to worry about.
